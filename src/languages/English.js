          <p>However, to <b>earn royalties from your data in the long-term, the data also has to be bought on the <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/t/dataunion-app-oceandao-round-7/694">Data Portal</a>. On the Data Portal, we will make it visible how often each data item is being sold, to indicate which data is in demand and which isn't.</p>
          <p>Based on existing business dynamics, we already have some insights regarding which image data is valuable - <b>object data</b> is very valuable.</p>
          <p>If there are one or more objects clearly visible in your image, this increases the chance that businesses will be interested in buying your data. Another factor which adds value to your images, is <b>the presence of objects in unexpected forms and in interesting situations</b> (e.g. a traffic sign with a graffiti on it, roadkill, kissing cats or a duck sitting on a car). Diversity of data is very important in Computer Vision, because companies want to build algorithms that can detect objects in a wide variety of situations. So get creative, and figure out your niche to fill!</p>
          <p>Another way to get rewards after the challenges, are <b>data bounties</b>. (see below) To take part in a data bounty, you have to upload an image that fits one of the data bounties, and then add the appropriate tag through the checkboxes.</p>
          <p>To test which types of data are in-demand, we are adding a number of data bounties during the challenges. This gives us insight into how well these bounties can be fullfilled and also will fuel algorithms that we want to develop/improve. Additionally we chose data bounty categories that can highlight the diversity and global present of our community.

A partial algorithm of this will be the anonymization of faces, this will be the first initial algorithm offering that we will launch on the Data Portal. Contributors to this data will then also get rewarded with datatokens of this algorithm. We are sure that our DataUnion.app community from around the world will be able to create a diverse dataset that will yield a highly succesful algorithm.</p>

Another potential usecase for this would be the option to create an optical store inventory system - when the items are accepted the store owner takes pictures of the packages and the phone stores how many there are in the inventory. The store owner and the employess take pictures at the checkout counter and the system automatically updates the inventory. If the buyers are checking out digitally they could even use an app to take pictures themself and pay e.g. via crypto. The tag for this bounty is: <b>product bounty</b></p>

        <p>If you see faces that are clearly recognizable, such as portraits, selfies and faces from a medium distance, or if you think a face recognition software would be able to identify a person based on the image, we consider them biometric. Of course, the distinction isn’t always clear, so we will show you samples you can take as a guide.<br>If you see personal information on a picture, you simply categorize it as “PII”. Things to look for are distant faces that are not immediately recognizable, license plates, names, addresses, computer or smartphone screens (and screenshots) displaying personal information, bills, invoices, envelopes, post and business cards, bank and credit cards, and anything else you may find that contains similar data.
