          <p>Fundamental movement skills are essential for participation in physical activity and reducing the risk of injury, which are both key elements of health throughout life. VisioTherapy are creating handheld video technologies to aid physios and other users to quantify, track and improve motion skills during typical daily exercises.</p> 
          <p>These technologies use deep learning and computer vision algorithms that are trained using video datasets of exercises of interest that are collected in a diverse range of environments. Usually a tech company would collect this data, before training and monetising the algorithm. In contrast, we want to crowdsource a dataset and give ownership back to the contributors so that value from the algorithms flows to the community.</p>
          <p>We ask users to upload videos of any exercise performed by a human. Please add some text to describe (i) the type of exercise, (ii) a comment on the quality of the exercise performed (e.g. good/bad performance, off balance, movement affected due to injury to knee), and (iii) your level of expertise (e.g. no expertise, physiotherapist, coach).</p>
          <p>We have also created <b>data bounties</b> (see below) for certain exercises of particular interest. To take part in a data bounty, you have to upload a video that fits one of the data bounties, and then add the appropriate tag through the checkboxes.</p>
